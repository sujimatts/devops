We discuss the guiding principles for observability, including its components and features, and then discuss recipes to apply it to useful applications.

#  What Is Observability?
Observability is the ability to derive a valid conclusion of what is happening currently to the system and why it is happening.

# Guiding Principles for Observability 
Context and sequential flow of each end-tend-end request is most important. We need to be able to see what is having an issue, which other parts might/are affected and what are the commonalities of issues when  things go wrong.
Must be able to cut the data in many ways and correlate the different aspects of a request (e.g. ability to filter for each user, their session, each server node and any of them combined with  the other attributes)
Use questions to drive features required for observability instead of relaying on what we can see.
