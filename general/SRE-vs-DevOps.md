# SRE vs DevOps
Both methodologies enforce minimal separation between Development and Operations teams. But we can sum up the key difference as this: DevOps focuses more on a cultural and philosophical shift, and SRE is more pragmatic and practical.

This highlights various differences in how the concepts operate, including:

  ## Essence. 
  SRE was developed with a narrow focus: to create a set of practices and metrics that allow for improved collaboration and service delivery. DevOps, on the other hand, is the collection of philosophies that enable the mindset of culture and collaboration between siloed teams.
  ## Goal. 
  Both SRE and DevOps aim to bridge the gap between development and operations, though SRE involves prescriptive ways of achieving reliability, while DevOps works as a template that guides collaboration.
  ## Focus. 
  Site reliability engineering mainly focuses on enhancing system availability and reliability while DevOps focuses on speed of development and delivery while enforcing continuity.
  ## Team structure. 
  An SRE team is composed of site reliability engineers who have a background in both operations and development. DevOps teams include a variety of roles, including QA experts, developers, engineers, SREs and many others.
