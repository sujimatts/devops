# Most popular Case styles are:

  - Camel case
  - Snake case & Capitalized Snake Case
  - Kebab case
  - Pascal case

## 1. Camel case

```camel Case``` starts with a lowercase letter and the first letter of every new subsequent word has its first letter capitalized and is compounded(removing the space between two words) with the previous word. This is a very popular way to combine words to form a single one.

```
RAW:

hello world!
```
```
camel Case:

helloWorld!
```

## 2. Snake case

```Snake case``` combines words by replacing each space with an underscore (_) and lowercasing all the words. This one is the most used in Python. This is a nice, clean, readable way to combine words.

Use: Often used as in declaring constants in many languages.

Let’s have a look at an example:
```
RAW:

my name is Ayushi
```
```
Snake case:

my_name_is_Ayushi
```
In the all caps version, all letters are capitalized, called as Capitalized Snake Case:

Let’s have a look at an example:
```
RAW:

max student marks
```
```
Capitalized Snake Case:

MAX_STUDENT_MARKS
```

## 3. Kebab case

This one is like Snake Case but instead of underscore, the dash is used, it combines words by replacing each space with a dash (-).

Use: This is rarely used in Python, but is often used in URLs.

Let’s have a look at an example:
```
Raw:

total student count
```
```
Kebab Case:

total-student-count
```

## 4. Pascal case

This case is also called Upper Camel Case, it combines all words by capitalizing all of them(even the first word) and removing the space between them.

Use: It is often used as a convention in declaring classes in many languages such as Python like CalculateSum.

Let’s have a look at an example:
```
Raw:

python is cool
```
```
Pascal Case:

PythonIsCool
```
